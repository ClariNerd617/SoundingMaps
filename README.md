# SoundingMaps
 Overlay small soundings above a map.

 This is very much a work in progress! The plotting routines are a bit clumsy
 and it's not as easy as it should be to change domain locations/sizes.

 I'm posting this so others in the community can adapt it for their own ideas,
 help make it better, and also so I can learn more about how the development
 of open-source code actually works. Any and all tips/advice about how to work
 best in github, good coding practices, how to make this script or others like
 it more efficient, etc. are very much welcomed!

 Enjoy and happy coding.
